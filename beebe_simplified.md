Really, self-growth is what all of this stuff is really, ultimately all about!

Naturally, what happens in midlife, is that when the ego grows a bit bored of seeing life through its lifelong perspectives (seeing they haven't really solved the pains of life), it weakens its defenses, and the suppressed perspectives will be able to come into consciousness more. For instance, the Trickster will be "flooding consciousness with paradoxes that have no solution within the framework the ego has established". (Lenore Thomson, Personality Pathways). The ego can either continue trying to resist, or instead become more open to them. (Hence, it's not a matter of the functions automatically "developing" like the first four did). This is what is supposed to lead towards "individuation".

In short, the four basic positions can be summed up as

+ 1, 5 ego's identity and advancement
+ 2, 6 ego's authority over others
+ 3, 7 ego's submission or deference
+ 4, 8 ego's connection to life, aspirations

So it seems, the way the complexes (the more negative ones, mainly) are constellated, is that 

1. we feel {inferior, obstructed, negated, double bound, ego threatened} .
2. we then project this onto others
3. we then respond in kind

So here now are the pertinent complexes.

The thing to remember, is that anyone can do any of these things using the functional perspectives, but for the type with that function connected to that archetype, there will be a heightened emotional investment in the action or reaction, as the function translates the emotional responses involving the complex into cognitive information.

##HERO (dominant)##

Since this is the ego's main standpoint, we probably don't often project it at others. We "own" it right off the bat. It is "us", at least in our conscious self-image.
I imagine it's when we're really young, and we look up to those who manifest the perspective that will become dominant in our own consciousness. We then seek to be like them and emulate them; becoming better and better at the process as we go on. We eventually master it, and thus are able to withdraw the projection; seeing ourselves as the "hero" in this area.

As "operating charters", the emotionally positive sense of heroically solving a problem would best be captured by the rational mind through the following perspectives:

+ Se (ESxP): The environment must be scanned for tangible experiences
+ Si (ISxJ): Life must be familiar to my storehouse of data
+ Ne (ENxP): The environment must be inferred for alternative possibilities
+ Ni (INxJ): Life must have an underlying significance inferred by me
+ Te (ExTJ): The environment must be efficiently organized
+ Ti (IxTP): Life must make technical sense to me
+ Fe (ExFJ): The environment must be socially friendly
+ Fi (IxFP): Life must be humanely congruent to me

##GOOD PARENT (auxiliary)##

You would think we likewise don't project this much, since we see it as just as integral to our type as the dominant. But since (according to Lenore) we often jump straight to the tertiary defense, we apparently do not always completely own the complex. 
When we do, we reportedly gain a strong motivation to teach and mentor others, and sometimes going to the opposite extreme of what's been called "preaching the auxiliary". The person now rigorously "parents" others with their perspective, including their method of owning the complex.

I imagine projecting the parent would mean you would see others as parent figures you want to help you with the perspective of the function in that position. Running to the tertiary, we're playing a role of "child" (that function's archetypal shell) anyway. Again, when we mature in the function, we then take a more "parental" role, and would then withdraw the projection.

But being in a heavy SJ environment, I have probably not had many people I could project this onto, so I believe I owned it pretty early, making my Ne very strong (as reflected by the cognitive process test), to the point of seeming to be possibly my dominant.

The emotionally positive sense of authoritatively supporting others is best captured by the rational mind through:

+ Se (ISxP): Aiding others in tangible experiences
+ Si (ESxJ): Teaching others according to what's familiar
+ Ne (INxP): Showing others alternative possibilities
+ Ni (ENxJ): Showing others underlying significance of things
+ Te (IxTJ): Directing others to efficiently organize the environment
+ Ti (ExTP): Teaching others according to logically truth
+ Fe (IxFJ): Instructing others on group ethics or values
+ Fi (ExFP): Teaching others by one's own personal relation to situations

##PUER/PUELLA ("eternal child", tertiary)##

Since this would be the function our egos run to to maintain the dominant attitude, we probably don't project this associated complex onto others. The ego naturally owns it quickly. (Projection would be seeing others as "children" in some way). 

The tertiary thus "inflates" itself, aiming to appear full of "wisdom and maturity" and be equal to the dominant or auxiliary of others. Yet then it deflates itself, and I (for instance) become like a child wanting to be taken and led into the innocent past through nostalgic interests. It also tends to "tell us what we want to hear" (for me, relying on what I know to be factually true).

Actually, all conscious complexes tend to inflate themselves. It's actually the ego that is doing the inflating, as it seeks to be the center of the psyche (in place of the Self). So since the tertiary is the ego's first line of defense of the dominant perspective, it seems to be the one that is seen "inflating" the most.

The emotionally positive sense of child-like relief is best captured by the rational mind through:

+ Se (ENxJ): Looking to be led by others in tangible experiences
+ Si (INxP): Nostalgic enjoyment of memories, especially childhood
+ Ne (ESxJ): childlike exploring of alternatives, new possibilities
+ Ni (ISxP): childlike exploring of underlying significances
+ Te (ExFP): Finding relief in organizing the environment
+ Ti (IxFJ): Childlike exploration of logical frameworks
+ Fe (ExTP): childlike when connecting with others
+ Fi (IxTJ): Find relief through internal harmony; personally relating to situations represents innocence

Now, we enter the realm of the less conscious complexes; the ones that do get heavily projected onto others, and need to be owned.

When we project the encompassing complexes onto people, they seem to fit those roles, generally involving the function-attitude in that position in some way, and we react oppositionally in kind with that function. Or, they might genuinely be fitting the role in their own behavior. 
To own the complex instead of projecting it at others, we must see ourselves as playing those roles; our own worst enemies. 
This is hard, because these parts of us are what we have shut out of our consciousness. 


##ANIMA (inferior, aspirational)##

###What it is about, and which function it encases:###

The collecting place of our sense of "otherness", including life, libido and and instinctual energies. The word means "soul". Shaped largely by the parent of the opposite sex, projected onto those we fall in love with, and encases the inferior function.

We likely feel inferior in both the internal or external orientation, and the functional perspective associated with the inferior.

Possible drawbacks from the emotionally freighted sense of connecting with life:

+ ISxJ's might feel inferior in new possibilities.
+ INxJ's might feel inferior with current tangible experience.
+ IxTP's might feel inferior in humane (personal) matters (including one's standing in social groups).
+ IxFP's might feel inferior in technical (impersonal) matters, such as regarding logical organization. 
+ ESxP's might feel inferior (spaced out) by conceptual frameworks such as archetypes and symbolism.
+ ENxP's might feel inferior when it comes to a storehouse of tangible acts, such as learned order
+ ExTJ's might feel inferior on a humane level, including personal integrity.
+ ExFJ's might feel inferior on a technical level, such as regarding logical understanding.

###How we project it onto others:###

+ ISxJ's Cling to dominant perspective. Criticize NP's as irresponsible regarding learned knowledge
+ INxJ's Cling to dominant perspective. Criticize SP's as reckless
+ IxTP's Appear insensitive or unfeeling and openly complain about FJ types. 
+ IxFP's Criticize other's organization
+ ESxP's Criticize this stuff as irrelevant.
+ ENxP's Dismiss learned methods as irrelevant
+ ExTJ's Become defensive and develop a martyrdom complex where it's everyone else's ethics that are bad.
+ ExFJ's Criticize others as illogical.

In each case, there's a deep down inside longing for what they are brushing off, that they might realize if they look for it. Especially in mid-life, when individuation takes us inward.

We (at least unconsciously) feel we would be best completed in the orientation by someone by our side who somehow fulfills the perspective. (Since this is a projection onto the person, they are not necessarily a type that prefers the function).

I imagine this might come out in the emotional images that surface when we think of a beautiful romantic day:

+ ISxJ's exploring new possibilities, to "create new memories".
+ INxJ's enjoying rigorous tangible experience together, and extracting meaning from it.
+ IxTP's strolling through a beautiful setting involving an atmosphere colored by other people; admiring technical things.
+ IxFP's working side by side at some sort of logical organization with a humanitarian purpose. 
+ ESxP's someone to get lost with in a world of conceptual frameworks such as archetypes and symbolism, and then realizing their dreams.
+ ENxP's enjoying nostalgia together, and exploring them as exciting possibilities
+ ExTJ's someone who gives them a sense of personal integrity, giving them further incentive for their logical ordering.
+ ExFJ's exploring technical wonders, and feeling connected through this.

Yet in real life, no one can ever fulfill this ideal companion, so we tend to just find fault with people who use the opposite perspective.

Since in the typical Beebe order where the eight are evenly divided four and four, the inferior usually falls on the "ego-syntonic" side, where the next four are "ego-dystonic" and negative. So Berens includes it with the first three as generally positive, having a negative side, rather than generally negative, having positive side. 
So the "negative" side of this "aspirational" function she calls "projective"; and often the first aspect of it experienced. We "project our fears, shoulds and negativities onto others". What happens, is that it basically shapes ideals we feel inferior in, which are then projected outward at others by thinking of them as what they "should" do.

In reality, it is all the shadows or unconscious complexes that get projected onto others. Of course, this harmonized with standard four-process theory, where the inferior IS considered to be the whole "shadow". 

So that is another aspect of the inferior projection besides just the opposite gender stuff.

###How to own it:###

We see others as completing us (i.e. we're inferior), but we need to see this completeness in ourselves. We need to become better at what we feel inferior at ourselves, rather than placing demands on others.
In the deeper Jungian concept, there is also a whole sense of "libido" or "life-giving energy" we tend to project onto the opposite sex (especially men projecting onto women). When we come to see this in ourselves, we will withdraw the projections, and also again gain more access to the unconscious. The anima/animus then becomes a "sage", and ultimately, an inner source of wisdom. There are two links on the anima below (Donald Kalsched, Paul Watsky) which will provide more information on this.

What is trying to be brought into consciousness is the need to own the shadow; what is "not I", the ego-dystonic; and a good place to start is with the [yet ego-syntonic] perspective of the opposite function and orientation together.

Now, to "the shadow", proper.
"The Shadow" was originally (to Jung) a single archetype that gets projected onto our enemies. In this model, it is of course divided into four distinct roles, shadowing the primary archetypes. (In the older model, it is just the inferior itself. So in this model, the inferior or anima/animus is often called "the bridge" to the unconscious).

##OPPOSING PERSONALITY COMPLEX##

###What it is about, and which functional perspective it encases:###

We feel negative emotions of our dominant perspective being obstructed by things in the opposite orientation. Then, we become stubborn about them. The complex then defends the dominant perspective in that opposite orientation. 

+ ISxJ's Feel obstructed in or become stubborn about tangible reality.
+ INxJ's Feel obstructed in or become stubborn about emergent meanings and possibilities
+ IxTP's Feel obstructed in or become stubborn about the way things are organized
+ IxFP's Feel obstructed in or become stubborn about group standards
+ ESxP's Feel obstructed in or become stubborn about their perceptions of how things once were
+ ENxP's Feel obstructed in or become stubborn about their perceptions of how the future will be
+ ExTJ's Feel obstructed in or become stubborn about models and principles and robotically following them
+ ExFJ's Feel obstructed in or become stubborn about personal values

###How we project it onto others:###

The subconscious attitude generally is: "you're obstructing me, so I'll oppose you". [I'm so immersed into my dominant orientation and oppose the opposite one, and project the opposition onto you]

+ ISxJ's Think that living in the moment is irresponsible. (However, some who do it are sexy).
+ INxJ's Probably think that multiple possibilities are absurd. The patterns point to one right conclusion.
+ IxTP's Think that agreed upon logical rules are stupid and a waste of time. Spunky Te types might be sexy
+ IxFP's Think that agreed upon ethics do not get to the real needs of people; affect them negatively, etc.
+ ESxP's Memorized rules and such are stupid and limiting of freedom.
+ ENxP's Taking only one possibility is stupid and limiting.
+ ExTJ's Breaking things down into trivial detail is stupid, inefficient and a waste of time
+ ExFJ's Tailoring everything to individual personal needs is too much trouble

###How to own it:###

We're making others into "opposing personalities" ("negative heroes" or "villains"), but we're really our own villain.

What is trying to be brought into consciousness: the need for the rejected orientation.

Ji/Pe types have chosen P and suppressed J. And Je/Pi types have chosen J and suppressed P. Hence, P's might not really make many decisions externally, but instead just try to get by under other people's order, with which we can easily find fault, but not offer much of a better solution ourselves. 

If we were to exercise (own) more of a J attitude (as represented by our dominant function's opposite orientation), we would be more proactive in the outer world and thus able to attain better positions of control and not feel so at the mercy of others. We would then be able to withdraw some of the vilification or criticism we direct at those in power. 
Likewise, if J's would likewise take on more of a [suppressed] P attitude, they would withdraw a lot of their blame on others for not being organized enough.

This complex is also usually contrasexual, like the anima/animus. It seems to be what we "lust" after in the opposite sex. While the anima is "madonna" or the "nice guy" we "love" in the opposite sex, this complex is the "whore" or "bad boy". (My own observation). This will especially be prominent in men who have not developed their anima to the stage where they dissociate it from their mother.


##WITCH/SENEX ("critical parent")##

###What it is about, and which functional perspective it encases:###

We feel negative emotions connected to extreme crankiness, as like an authoritarian figure whose position is negated, and then become "critical and disgruntled" (Berens) about the associated perception or judgment perspective. "Parent" others negatively in a limiting, authoritarian fashion.

+ ISxP's Feel negated in or become disgruntled about rememberance of facts. 
+ INxP's Feel negated in or become disgruntled about patterns and perceived significance of events (and what they appear to lead to). 
+ IxTJ's Feel negated in or become disgruntled about variable logical principles 
+ IxFJ's Feel negated in or become disgruntled about personal ethics 
+ ESxJ's Feel negated in or become disgruntled about current sensory experience (what things look like, etc). 
+ ENxJ's Feel negated in or become disgruntled about alternative possibilities. 
+ ExFP's Feel negated in or become disgruntled about group values
ExTP's Feel negated in or become disgruntled about set logical order

###How we project it onto others; how it might play in their subconscious mind:###

+ ISxP's Avoid past rememberances, except to blame, and will make them critical if others dwell too much
+ + I'M the authority on factual data, and you have dwelled too much on the past and should move on [I feel bad about the past, and project it onto you]

+ INxP's Interpret everything in terms of a "big picture" in which the worst will happen, and blame those around them: 
+ + I'M the authority on concepts and inferences. What you're doing fits (implies, infers, etc.) a negative pattern I see, and I'm going to stand against it. [I feel the patterns are against me, and project it onto you].

+ IxTJ's Will often angrily hit others with logical "truth" or principles:
+ + I'M the authority on logical order. You are being totally illogical! [I subconsciously know my logic is not very deep with my external focus, and I project this onto you]

+ IxFJ's Can angrily hit others with personal or universal ethical "truth":
+ + I'M the authority on ethics! Your behavior shows a lack of personal integrity. [I feel I'm not living up to the personal (internal) side of ethics with my external focus, and I project it onto you].

+ ESxJ's Very critical about the way things look, which they easily spot to find fault with (I call them "hawks")
+ + I'M the authority on tangible reality (e.g. how things look). What you're making is ugly. [I feel deficient in this area, and project it onto you].

+ ENxJ's Might attack people for bombarding them with alternative possibilities and meanings, especially if they do not have any "authority" to do so:
+ + I'M the authority on conceptual ideas. Your ideas are totally ridiculous! [I cannot handle multiple emergent possibilities and project this onto you]

+ ExTP's Will fight, compete and one-up others over the way things are ordered.
+ + I'M the authority on logical sense. You are being totally illogical! [I subconsciously know my logic is not readily practical to others with my internal focus, and I project this onto you]

+ ExFP's will authoritatively chastize those perceived as disrupting social harmony (and end up disrupting it themselves), and will reference standards imposed upon themselves:
+ + I'M the authority on ethics. You're displaying bad social behavior [I go against external values when they conflict my internal standard, yet my conscience bothers me about this, and I project it at you].

###How to own it:###

We see others as shaming, blaming "critical parents", setting limits on us in an authoritarian (Hunziker) fashion (and then react in kind), but we're really our own critical parent, and blaming others for this.

What is trying to be brought into consciousness through this is wisdom neglected in our preferred Parental complex.

##TRICKSTER (bad child, clown)##

###What it is about, and which functional perspective it encases:###

Emotions connected with that of a bad child; either dealing with one, playing tricks and binding the ego, or then being one to get back at or rebel against the threat, will often come through the perspective. Where the Puer tells us what we want to hear, the Trickster tells us what we don't want to hear! We feel "bound", and then, in a rebellious fashion, try to turn the tables by using it for deceiving, double-binding, trapping others

+ ISxP's Might feel 'double-bound' by alternative possibilities
+ INxP's Might feel 'double-bound' by tangible reality (physical things, etc), and then it seems to become the perfect vehicle to try to turn the tables on others with, or to be silly with. 
+ IxTJ's Might feel 'double-bound' by social values, and use them to trap others into behaving or conforming
+ IxFJ's Might feel 'double-bound' by set logical order, and make mistakes trying to implement it themselves
+ ESxJ's Might feel 'double-bound' by patterns or inferences, and use them to trap others into confirming their worst fears
+ ENxJ's Might feel 'double-bound' by memorized facts that go against ego, and use them to trap others
+ ExTP's Might feel 'double-bound' by a focus on personal values, and use them to trap others
+ ExFP's Might feel 'double-bound' by variable logical principles and use them to trap others or be silly

###How we project it onto others; how it might play in their subconscious mind:###

+ ISxP's See people tossing out alternative possibilities and meanings as bad children or clowns:
+ + HA! Got you! You're trying to bind me [I feel lost with emergent inferences and project it onto you] so I'm going to bind you with concepts and possibilities.
+ INxP's People performing rigorous stunts are clowns; people pointing out tangible reality that goes against the ego seem like "bullies":
+ + HA! Got you! You're trying to bind me [I feel bound by tangible reality and project it onto you], so I'm going to bind you with tangible reality
+ IxTJ's might criticize others' social behavior to scare them by saying they are bringing rejection on themselves:
+ + HA! Got you! You're trying to bind me with social rules [I feel bound by social rules and project it onto you], so I'l bind you with social etiquette
+ IxFJ's see people organizing things logically as "bad children":
+ + HA! Got you! You're trying to bind me [I feel confused by externally set technical order and make mistakes with it, and project it onto you] so I'm going to bind you with technical order.
+ ESxJ's see symbolism and inferences as silly, yet unconsciously use them themselves under stress, in a "bratty" fashion:
+ + HA! Got you! You're trying to bind me [I feel confused or lost with stored conceptual patterns and project it onto you], so I'm going to bind you by proving that you're confirming my worst intuitions.
+ ENxJ's People who dwell on the past (instead of moving on) are "puerile", and yet they might distort it to get them off their back:
+ + HA! Got you! You're trying to bind me [I feel trapped by stored facts and project it onto you], so I'm going to bind you with stored facts (including making you look crazy for bringing them up; e.g. the past).
+ ExTP's see opponent's passion in a dispute and try to outdo it themselves in a childish fashion:
+ + HA! Got you! You're trying to bind me [I feel bound by the personal side of situations such as universal values and project it onto you] so I'm going to bind you with ethical values.
+ ExFP's: All this archetype stuff ("puers trigger witches", etc. logical frameworks) is just excuses for bad behavior (I actually had one say this to me!):
+ + HA! Got you! You're trying to bind me [I feel confused or lost with technical variables and project it onto you] so I'm going to bind you with technical details.

###How to own it:###

We see others as a bad child or binding us, but we're being a bad child or binding ourselves.

What is trying to be brought into consciousness is the perspective orientation opposite the dominant one our "child" complex runs to. In severe trauma, the Self uses it to try to keep information out of consciousness, and bind a person from taking action that might expose the ego to more damaging content.

##DEMONIC PERSONALITY COMPLEX##

###What it is about, and which functional perspective it encases:###

The most suppressed area of consciousness. Also named by various theorists, "Internal Saboteur", "Bad Object" or "anti-libidinal ego". Carries emotions associated with evil, either someone trying to destroy the ego (real or apparently, imagined), or the ego in turn trying to destroy a [perceived] threat. Where the anima represents our connection to "life", the Demon conveys a association with death. Encases the opposite function of the dominant perspective orientation. 

+ ISxJ's deep conceptual meaning is an area of the unknown and runs totally counter to the concrete structure needed
+ INxJ's The past is highly irrelevant, and likely haunting
+ IxTP's the personal factor in situations, or conscience might be a nagging, guilt-provoking issue we wish could go away.
+ IxFP's Logical analysis totally depersonalizes life
+ ESxP's Interpretations of current reality are highly irrelevant
+ ENxP's "may get caught up in a binge of being in the physical moment; excessively seeking stimulation or following the urge to sleep or do nothing" (Berens)
+ ExTJ's Social harmony might be manipulated for personal goals (and at the expense of real harmony), rather than shaping one's own behavior
+ ExFJ's Logical order is a necessary evil done in a huff to accomplish goal of social harmony

###How we project it onto others; how it might play in their subconscious mind:###

+ ISxJ's see conceptual frameworks as crazy, yet use them under stress in an overblown fashion ("dire predictions with detailed certainty"):
+ + Your abstract dreamworld makes me feel totally lost [so I project this onto you], so I'm going to use negative inferences to make you feel threatened.
+ INxJ's "When really stressed, they may waste time reviewing the impact of the past."(Berens): 
+ + You're trying to destroy me with my past, [I feel threatened by stored facts (which I see as irrelevant as it is) used against me, and project it onto you], so I'm going to use your past to destroy you!
+ IxTP's Might become very envious and resentful at people seen as morally self-contented, and want nothing more than to upseat and expose them. They come across as evil hypocrites wearing a "good guy" mask. They then end up coming off as self-righteous themselves in trying to outdo these others. Also, self-destructive in expending time and energy passionately engaging in all-so-"important" personal causes against these objects of envy:
+ + You're trying to destroy my humanity to the core (internal), so I'm going to destroy yours! [I really want to self-destruct from my need for internal logical "sense" and external personal validation being violated, and I project this onto you]
+ IxFP's Logical analysis is cold and evil, and they'll use it to demolish someone else's analysis:
+ + Your impersonal analysis makes me feel totally depersonalized [and I project this onto you], so I'm going to destroy your logic
+ ESxP's: emergent conceptualization makes me feel totally lost and you're taking advantage of this:
+ + [I "over-read 'between the lines'" and project this onto you by "misinterpreting the meaning of someone's actions and attributing negative intentions where there were none" (Berens)], so I'm going to react accordingly.
+ ENxP's "zero in on isolated details, hastily acting on them in a chaotic disjointed way" (Berens): 
+ + feels undone by emergent tangible experience not under control of conceptual knowledge, and projects by trying to destroy others with rash impulsive reactions
+ ExTJ's Others are socially destructive, and are out to get me; I'm doing SO much for others, and not appreciated:
+ + You're trying to destroy me from the inside out (e.g. "my integrity"), so I'm going to destroy your standing on the outside [I really want to self-destruct from my need for my external logical image and internal personal validation being violated, and I project this onto you]
+ ExFJ's Others' disorder is making me crazy; frenzied rush to clean and fix everything or order the other person:
+ + Your lack of orderliness totally destroys my sense of [humane] harmony [I feel gravely overwhelmed in the logical aspect of external oder, and project it onto you], so I'm going to destroy your mess (or become highly irritable as I clean the area).

###How to own it:###

We see others as "devils" (destroyers) in these areas, but the destructive evil is really within us!

What is trying to be brought into consciousness is what the ego is fighting most against; the perspective opposite to its dominant function, but in its sacred preferred orientation. In severe trauma, the Self uses it to try to keep information out of consciousness to protect the ego from more damaging content; and demonic figures might appear in dreams threatening the ego with death if the ego's already fragile boundaries are being breached.

Owning this complex might make our ego feel it is in danger of becoming nonexistent, or transformed into the weak, pathetic, helpless image I mentioned earlier, that we despise as totally allowing the evil that opposed the ego to prevail. Think "Ichabod: the glory has departed". If the anima is the soul, then this represents the ego, rather than united with the soul, instead sapped of all life.
However, this figure, like the others, is really the ego's own projection. In actuality, it is really the "daimon"; the word "demon" is derived from, but without the necessarily evil connotation "demon" has taken on. The word means "replete with knowledge", "divine power," "fate" or "god." In Greek mythology, it included deified heroes. They were considered intermediary spirits between men and the gods.

Man was called not only to survive and reproduce, but to love and help others along the way. This includes showing grace and forgiveness, as we ourselves need. This would represent, what in Christian terminology is called "partaking of the Cross". Hence, why that poor pathetic archetype looks the way he does, and is even associated with evil. He has borne the entire shadow of the world! And our ego resists becoming this, in favor of its own goals, and seeking its own way. The unpreferred perspectives then often make the ego feel threatened. Particularly the inferior function when "infiltrating" the dominant orientation.

If we spend all our energy maintaining the ego's wishes and protesting our pains and disappointments, we eventually become the very evil we see in the world (which we are projecting on them as it is), and representing the "dark side" of life we would associate with "demons". If we accept more of a "suffering servant" mantle, then we become like "daimons" or "angels", being messengers of God, and true heroes; even if not recognized by the world.
